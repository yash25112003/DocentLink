        "education": "Adil Ahmad is an assistant professor in the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence (SCAI) at Arizona State University (ASU). His research interests broadly lie within the domains of computer security, systems, and architecture. His research goal is to protect sensitive data from powerful adversaries. To this end, he routinely leverages hardware-assisted trusted execution environments while addressing their fundamental limitations in terms of protection and usability. He also designs new principles to strengthen critical system software (like operating systems and hypervisors) on a computer. He is a recipient of a US DoD Defense Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (DEPSCoR) Award. Before joining ASU, he obtained a PhD from Purdue, working with Pedro Fonseca and Byoungyoung Lee. He also interned at Microsoft Research and NEC Labs, working with Sangho Lee, Marcus Peinado, and Chung Hwan Kim. Research interests: ['computer security', 'systems', 'architecture'].
