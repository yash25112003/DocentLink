I received my Ph.D. from [Yonsei\nUniversity](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/index.jsp) in South Korea. My\nresearch interests lie in mobile and wireless network security issues like\nTelco (5G), Access Control, Blockchain, and Digital Forensics. I don't aim to\nbe the outstanding instructor or researcherâ€”but I do hope to be an educator\nwho prepares with care and teaches with the conviction that I should always be\nuseful to someone, in some way. â˜• After a whirlwind semester teaching four\nsections with around 700 undergrads and over 100 grad students, I'm grateful\nto say I made it through! I also wrapped up six master's thesis defenses and\ntwo honors thesis reviews. It kind of feels like finishing a marathon. Now\nit's time for a short breakâ€”then back to prepping for the fall semester.\n\nðŸ“« jaejong at asu . edu\n\n## Latest News\n\n 1. Our paper\n\n[\"It's almost like Frankenstein: Investigating the Complexities of Scientific\nCollaboration and Privilege Management within Research Computing\nInfrastructures\"](https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-\narticle/sp/2025/223600c995/26hiVfWPKog)has been accepted in[46th IEEE\nSymposium on Security and Privacy (May 12-15, 2025, SAN\nFRANCISCO)](https://sp2025.ieee-security.org/). This paper examines security\nconsiderations in research computing infrastructures (RCIs) through\ninterviews with experts and stakeholders, highlighting a layered access control\napproach that challenges traditional models, as collaborative, trust-based\nsharing raises compliance concerns, and concludes with recommendations to\nenhance RCI security and flexibility.\n\n 2. Our paper\n\n[\"PendingMutent: An Authorization Framework for Preventing PendingIntent\nAttacks in Android-based Mobile Cyber-Physical Systems,\"](../papers/pending-\nmutent-satcps2025.pdf)has been accepted in[ACM Workshop on Secure and\nTrustworthy Cyber-Physical Systems (SaT-CPS\n2025)](https://sites.google.com/view/sat-cps-2025), organized in conjunction\nwith the 15th ACM Conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy\n(CODASPY 2025)\n\n 3.
