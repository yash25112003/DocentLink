The 'teaching' section is simplified to a string. The 'education' section now includes a 'year' field.  The 'publications' section now includes a 'pdf' field for the publication's PDF link. Data types are chosen to accurately reflect the input data. URL and date validation are applied where appropriate using the 'format: url' and 'format: date' keywords.",
