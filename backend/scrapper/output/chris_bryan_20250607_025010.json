Fulton Schools of Engineering at Arizona State University. I lead the Sonoran Visualization Laboratory (SVL @ ASU). I am also an affiliate faculty with ASU's Global Security Initiative. I received my Ph.D. at the University of California, Davis as a part of the VIDi lab. My research spans the areas of data visualization, human-computer interaction, augmented and virtual reality, and data science. Broadly, I develop novel algorithms, models, techniques, and interaces that help humans make sense of data. My research group regularly works with complex and real-world data, and develops advanced interactive visual analytics and data pipelines, including exploring advanced data in new ways, modeling and interpreting machine learning and artificial intelligence, and explaining or storytelling with data."
