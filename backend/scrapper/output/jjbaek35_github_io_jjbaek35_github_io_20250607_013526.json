I received my Ph.D. from Yonsei University in South Korea. My research interests lie in mobile and wireless network security issues like Telco (5G), Access Control, Blockchain, and Digital Forensics. I don't aim to be the outstanding instructor or researcher—but I do hope to be an educator who prepares with care and teaches with the conviction that I should always be useful to someone, in some way. ☕ After a whirlwind semester teaching four sections with around 700 undergrads and over 100 grad students, I'm grateful to say I made it through! I also wrapped up six master's thesis defenses and two honors thesis reviews. It kind of feels like finishing a marathon. Now it's time for a short break—then back to prepping for the fall semester.",
