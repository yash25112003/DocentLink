            "markdown": ": I am an assistant professor in the [School of Computing and Augmented\nIntelligence (SCAI)](https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/) at Arizona State\nUniversity (ASU). My research interests broadly lie within the domains of\ncomputer security, systems, and architecture. My research goal is to protect\nsensitive data from powerful adversaries. To this end, I routinely leverage\nhardware-assisted trusted execution environments while addressing their\nfundamental limitations in terms of protection and usability. I also design\nnew principles to strengthen critical system software (like operating systems\nand hypervisors) on a computer. I am a receipient of a US DoD [Defense\nEstablished Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (DEPSCoR)\nAward](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3711356/dod-\nannounces-defense-established-program-to-stimulate-competitive-research-awa/).\n\nBefore joining ASU, I spent many enjoyable years obtaining a PhD from Purdue\n(go boilermakers!), where I was extremely fortunate to work with [Pedro\nFonseca](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/pfonseca/) and [Byoungyoung\nLee](https://lifeasageek.github.io/). During my PhD, I greatly enjoyed\ninterning at Microsoft Research and NEC Labs, where I worked with [Sangho\nLee](https://sangho2.github.io/), [Marcus\nPeinado](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/marcuspe/), and\n[Chung Hwan Kim](https://chungkim.gitlab.io/).\n\n❗ I am looking to hire PhD students for exciting systems and security research\nprojects. If you are interested in working in this area, please reach out\nthrough email.\n---\n⚠️ I do not hire students as graders or TAs for a class, if they have not\npreviously taken the class.\n---\n\n## Recent Updates\n\n * Gave a talk at Seoul National University (SNU) on our recent research endeavours towards designing a secure logging infrastructure for mission-critical computers.\n\n * [Laputa](https://adil-ahmad.net/xxx)was accepted to appear at ISOC NDSS 2025!\n * [Pooyan Fazli](https://pooyanfazli.com/),[Hasti Seifi](https://hastiseifi.com/), and I have received a 2024 Google ExploreCSR award to expand our outreach activities (including the Desert CodeSprouts Workshop). Thanks Google!\n * Chairing SCAI's effort to hire faculty in the broad area of Operating Systems, Compilers, and Programming Languages. Please find the job posting\n\n[here](https://apply.interfolio.com/157464).\n\n * [HitchHiker](https://adil-ahmad.net/papers/zhang-hitchhiker.pdf)was accepted to appear at ACM CCS 2024! Congratulations to Chuqi and all my collaborators. You can find the research artifact on[GitHub](https://github.com/ASTERISC-Release/HitchHiker).\n * Intel has donated data center equipment to our research lab to help pursue secure enclave-related research. Thanks Intel!\n\n * Invited to serve in the program committees of\n\n[USENIX OSDI 2025](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi25)and[USENIX\nSecurity 2025](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25). Please\nsubmit your best systems and security work!\n\n * Read all about the Desert CodeSprouts Workshop in this\n\n[news article](https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/news/training-the-techies-of-\ntomorrow/).\n\n * Organized the\n\n[1st Desert CodeSprouts Workshop for Middle-School\nStudents](https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/desert-codesprouts-workshop/)in the\nGreater Phoenix area. Thank you to all the participants, coordinators,\nvolunteers, and especially the workshop co-founder (Prof. Hasti Seifi).\nSpecial thanks to the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence (SCAI)\nand[the American Cybersecurity Education](http://ace-institute.asu.edu/)(ACE)\nInstitute for co-sponsoring this event. Please stay tuned for future workshop\nevents at our[website](https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/desert-codesprouts-\nworkshop/)!\n\n * Invited to serve in the program committees of\n\n[IEEE S&P 2025](https://sp2025.ieee-security.org/),[ACM EuroSys\n2025](https://2025.eurosys.org/), and[IEEE HPCA 2025](https://hpca-\nconf.org/2025/).
